! Welcome to IMPACT-T interactions input file.
! All comment lines start with "!" as the first character of the line.
!
! This file defines any interactions in the simulation.
! To use interactions, the main input file must have the interact flag ON (1).
!
! General settings:
!   - N: Number of interaction types
!   - p: Residual gas pressure (Pa)
!   - T: Residual gas temperature (deg C)
!
! N   p (Pa)   T (deg C)

! Interaction definitions: one line per interaction type
!   - Type:   A code number corresponding to a particular type of interaction:
!             1: Dissociation
!   - Source: The bunch ID of the source particles (see below)
!   - Target: The bunch ID of the target particles (see below)
!   - E_peak: The energy at which the interaction cross-section is peaked (eV)
!   - Sigma:  The interaction cross-section at this peak energy (m^2)
!   - dz:     The interval at which to run the interaction (m)
!
! For the bunch IDs, start counting from the main bunch 1 in ImpactT.in, add
!   any additional bunches from additional input files ImpactTx.in, then add
!   any interaction bunches defined below.
! For example, to dissociate one molecular hydrogen H_2^+ ion into two protons,
!   the source bunch would be `1` for the main bunch in ImpactT.in, and
!   the target bunch would be `2` for the interaction bunch below.

! Interaction bunch definitions
!   - i:     Bunch number (not including standard bunches from ImpactTx.in)
!   - I:     Starting beam current (A)
!   - E:     Starting particle energy (eV)
!   - m:     Particle rest mass (eV)
!   - q:     Particle charge (e)
!   - phi:   Starting phase (rad)
!   - N_st:  Number of particles in the interaction bunch at the start
!   - N_max: Maximum number of particles in the interaction bunch
!              (set to zero to use multiple of main bunch)
!   - N_x:   Multiplier of main bunch count
!              (e.g. `2.0` for 1 hydrogen -> 2 protons,
!                    `0.5` for 2 proton   -> 1 hydrogen ion)
!
! The values npt-max and npt-factor must be large enough to accept all possible
!   interaction products from all simulated interactions, otherwise the
!   simulation will run out of space in the interaction bunch.
